# Benefits to users

Why should we as citizens care and advocate for MyData? 

## The Ability to Transfer Data Easily

It’s not a rare case that women get pregnant. In user research into what women have to do in order to get maternity leave from their jobs uncovers huge gaps in transferring data. 

- When a woman gets pregnant, she has to go to her doctor in order to get a verification of pregnancy  
- This verification paper has to be taken to her organization’s occupational healthcare or HR who often request her to fill in a form to apply for maternity leave.  
- To get public benefits during the maternity leave, the same piece of paper verifying the pregnancy must be provided to the public  institution in charge of the benefits who request filling out another form.

Running around town passing papers sounds like quite a hassle, doesn’t it? 

What if after having the pregnancy verified by a doctor, the lady in question could just access the validated data generated about her and choose where and at what detail she would like to transfer it? This uncovers some of the user benefits of MyData. What if you had access to data generated about you from any area of life and share it with other applications, services and organizations.
