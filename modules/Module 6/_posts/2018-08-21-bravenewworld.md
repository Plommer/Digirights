# The Brave New World: Open or Closed Data Ecosystems?

Like we stated in the introduction of this module, the notion of MyData and personal data at our disposal are still visions for the future of our digital citizen rights. What the future will shape up to be is up to the global societies: citizens, NGOs, governments and businesses. 

As we noted in the Data Portability section, currently it is large platforms that are best suited for collecting and sharing our data over a wide range of use cases. The problem is we don’t have a lot of choice beyond these platforms. What the MyData movement seeks to enable is the open, decentralized usage of personal data so that we as people and citizens have the opportunity to have services that are tailored around them, not just join existing ecosystems.  

## Closed, Centralized Data Ecosystems

Finnish researchers Juri Mattila, Timo Seppälä and Jan Holmström say that these centralized platforms are a step forward from the internet that we had before simply because we were limited to dealing with individual organizations and services that shared only little data between them. Life is easier now that we carry in our pockets our walkmans, our calendars, our telephones and a wide range of previous devices. The connectivity of the data sources that the platforms provide has made it ever easier for the network effects of ecosystems growing by the number of people participating.

## Open, Decentralized Data Ecosystems

Centralized platforms are still another version of the industrial world where single corporations can dominate the markets. Think of Uber which is a great service for those needing a ride but takes a large chunk of the revenue generated that had previously gone to those providing the actual services: the drivers. 

Juri Mattila, Timo Seppälä and Jan Holmström speak about an emerging form of platforms which is decentralized meaning, there is not center thus enabling organizations and people to have more choice in what types of services they want in their lives.

Watch the following video from Complexity Labs to understand the opportunities and implications of decentralized platforms and the decentralized web.

Even though we now “Google” for information or “Uber” to our friend’s party, the future might not be centralized around these organizations and their services but rather cater to our individual ja personal needs that are based on sharing our personal data in a controlled manner.
