# Data Portability - The Ability to Transfer Your Data Easily

As stated earlier, the ability to transfer your data easily or, using it’s technical term, data portability, is at the center of MyData and the future of personal data. 

The example of the pregnant lady from the previous section depicts a person’s problem of not being able to transfer data between parties with whom we have to deal with in our everyday lives. There might be some point to point opportunities for transferring data but often we citizens are the ones who carry pieces of paper around from place to place.

In today’s world we have some large platform players such as Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon and Microsoft that are able to handle a large portion of the data that we create and use in our everyday lives. The reason why we are so compelled to being customers of the Apple ecosystem is the seamless experience we can have with our devices and our applications, helping us do things better in our lives. But the problem with these big players is that it is very difficult to change away from them.

The MyData vision of data portability is that you as a person or a citizen should have a 360 view into your data and be able to provision or transfer it from one place to the other easily.

If you would not be content with the services that Facebook is providing for you to engage with friends, groups and pages, having the option of data portability would help you easily transfer your data from Facebook to another similar service like Google+ or possibly something else that might be in tune with you values and your needs.

## Glossary

**Data portability:**  
If I want to switch service providers without losing all my history, contacts, photos and other information or be able to use this data elsewhere, I want to be able have data portability. The ability to transfer your data from one service to another in a simple manner and using a machine-readable format is called data portability.
