# Exercise

Choose two digital services you are already using.

What benefits could you get if you were able to combine data from both of them? Focus on how you might understand something better or be able to do more. Donâ€™t think of just for getting discounts by sharing the data between the services.

Make a 1 page text or 1 minute Youtube video where you explain your idea and data. Send a link to the discussion forum. After this comment on two other participants submissions.
