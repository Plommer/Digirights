# How does data portability of MyData actually work?

The ability to transfer your data easily, or data portability, might sound like an easy concept but there is a lot of things that have to happen on the background for it to almost as simple as clicking on a few buttons. 

Data portability in the MyData context is a bit more difficult than pressing a button because it requires a little bit of thinking and considering. The figure below depicts the basic elements of what might enable data portability. 

**The individual / data subject / account owner** has the opportunity to control and transfer their data from place to place by providing consents, low-level contracts that, first, provide the permissions for the data to be shared and, second, regulate the granularity or detail of the data that is shared. 

**The MyData operator** can provide the MyData accounts that help store the data about your consents in a central manner so that you can gain a more holistic view into where you are sharing your data. Many people use password managers to keep track of the passwords they use in many sites or services. The MyData operator works similarly: it contains a list of the services you are sharing your data with and the consents related to them. Similarly as you can have many bank accounts, you can also have many MyData operators. 

In the MyData data portability model, **data sources** are the original sources of data related to you. For example, the government might own the validated data source for your identity: your name, your birthday and your address. By issuing consent, you could for example transfer this data to a bank to open a bank account and keep your address information up-to-date.

**Data sinks or Data using services** are the services that use your data and provide you additional benefits. In the case of using your data to open a bank account, the bank provides the data using services. 

**Data flows** move between the data sources and data using services. In the bank account case, the data flow is all the data related to your identity that the bank needs and you are willing to share. 

**Consent flows** move digitally between the MyData operators and data sources to provide the data sources the information on what data should be transferred and to which services. Consent flows between the MyData operators and data using services provide the data using services with the consent data which tells them that they are permitted to use the data that is coming from the data sources.

The general overview of the elements and roles related to data portability still requires adding the technical, design or user experience and contractual aspects to be fulfilled. Currently there are no popular standards for doing these even though these are being developed in many places. 

### Glossary

**Data portability:**  
If I want to switch service providers without losing all my history, contacts, photos and other information or be able to use this data elsewhere, I want to be able have data portability.

**Data source:**  
The source of different types of personal data. 

**Data subject:**  
The person who is the subject or the topic of the data. 

**MyData operator:**  
The MyData operators can provide the MyData accounts that help store the data about your consents in a central manner so that you can gain a more holistic view into where you are sharing your data.
