# Module 2 : GDPR in a nutshell
&nbsp;

### Learning outcomes of the module

By taking this module you will know the new rights gained with the GDPR and exercise them for your own benefit, for the lawfulness of your service providers and to be better able to protect your own personal data and its use.

GDPR, which is the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation, that came into full force on the 26th of May, 2018. Knowing that these rights exist, is necessary to exercise them.

Essentially, you have the right

- [know how your personal data is used](http://digirights.info/modules/module%202/howdataisused/)
- [know if an organization is using your personal data and request for it](http://digirights.info/modules/module%202/righttoaccess)
- [correct information about you](http://digirights.info/modules/module%202/righttocorrect/)
- [ask for erasing data held of you](http://digirights.info/modules/module%202/rightoferasure/)
- [restrict or deny using some of your data](http://digirights.info/modules/module%202/righttodeny/)
- [to move your personal data to other services](http://digirights.info/modules/module%202/dataportability/)
- [not to be subject to decisions made only by machines](http://digirights.info/modules/module%202/denymachines/)
- [know if your personal data has been breached within 72 hours](http://digirights.info/modules/module%202/databreach/)

On top of these, the data processor can’t even store your personal data, if it fails to meet all of these six lawful bases to do so.

### What are the lawful bases for processing? 

The lawful bases for processing are set out in Article 6 of the GDPR. At least one of these must apply whenever you process personal data: 

**(a) Consent:**
 the individual has given clear consent for you to process their personal data for a specific purpose.

**(b) Contract:**
 the processing is necessary for a contract you have with the individual, or because they have asked you to take specific steps before entering into a contract.

**(c) Legal obligation:**
 the processing is necessary for you to comply with the law (not including contractual obligations).

**(d) Vital interests:**
 the processing is necessary to protect someone’s life.

**(e) Public task:**
 the processing is necessary for you to perform a task in the public interest or for your official functions, and the task or function has a clear basis in law.

**(f) Legitimate interests:**
 the processing is necessary for your legitimate interests or the legitimate interests of a third party unless there is a good reason to protect the individual’s personal data which overrides those legitimate interests. (This cannot apply if you are a public authority processing data to perform your official tasks.)

***However, an individual always has the right to object to processing for the purposes of direct marketing, whatever lawful basis applies.***
