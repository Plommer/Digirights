# Session 7 : Right to move your personal data to other services
&nbsp;

### If you want to have your data moved

In certain situations, you have the right to receive your data and transfer them to another service provider.

The right to data portability makes it easier for you to change service providers. For example, if you would like to change your electricity company, it could be useful to transfer the previous provider's accumulated data on you and your power consumption to the new provider.

Personal data refers to information by which you can be identified.

A service provider that collects personal data on you is called a controller.

You have the right to receive the personal data concerning you from the controller in a commonly used format in order to deliver them to another service provider. You can also ask the controller to transmit your data directly to another controller where technically feasible.

The personal data can only be transferred if

- its processing was based on your consent or an agreement between yourself and the controller or
- it was processed automatically.

Transferring your personal data does not necessarily mean that it will be erased from the original controller's systems. However, you do have the right to request the controller to erase your personal data from its file.

In most cases, the transfer of data is free of charge. If your request is unfounded or unreasonable, the controller has the right to charge a reasonable fee or refuse the request.

### How to proceed

Make the request directly to the controller. Additional information on the correct channels can usually be obtained from the controller's website or customer service.

In the request, specify

- which data your request involves
- whether you would like the controller to deliver the data to you or transfer it directly to another controller
- your name and
- your contact details (such as your e-mail address or telephone number).

The controller is required to reply to your request within one month. If the requests are numerous or complex, the controller can reply that it needs more time to process them. If the controller announces that it needs more time for processing, the deadline for replying will be three months from your original request. Wait for the controller's reply. Notifying you of a longer processing time does not mean that the controller will refuse to transfer the data.

If the controller refuses to transfer the data you have requested, it must state the reasons for its refusal. The refusal must always be based on law. If you feel that the controller did not have legal grounds for its refusal, you can contact the Data Protection Ombudsman if necessary.
