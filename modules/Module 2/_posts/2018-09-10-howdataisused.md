# Session 2: The right to know how your data is used
&nbsp;

You have the right to obtain information on the purpose for which your personal data is collected and how it is processed.

A company, authority or corporation processing your personal data is called a controller. Parties such as your employer, bank and operators that collect data from you on the internet are controllers with regard to your personal data.

When a controller is in possession of your personal data, it must inform you of

- the identity of the controller
- the reason why your personal data is necessary
- for how long your personal data will be necessary
- whether your personal data will be disclosed to other parties and
- how you can exercise your rights with regard to your personal data.

The controller will normally provide these details on the processing of your personal data in writing. Information is frequently also available on the controller's website.

If you give your personal data directly to the controller, such as on a form, the controller is required to give you information on its processing immediately.

Controllers can also obtain your personal data from other sources than yourself. In such cases, they are usually required to inform you of its processing within one month.
