How the services then know so much about us? 

If you think of yourself in front of your device, your clicks of links, the time you spent reading a page or watching a video, the time you write a post and publish it, the time you write but discard your post, the time you like something, literally anything you do can be tracked. 

These actions can be named “digital footprint” or “digital shadow”. When you walk in sunshine, you cast a shadow that touches other shadows. Similarly, when you browse internet, you leave a shadow behind you, which is linked to other shadows.

These shadows can be divided into passive and active actions. Passive ones are those you don’t realise leaving behind, such as how many seconds you watched a video. Active ones are those you create knowingly, such as social media posts. 

Mikko Hypponen from F-Secure recommends everybody using services like Twitter or Facebook as regular users, some time using the service as a paying customer, to set up an ad and paying for it. While posting your ad, you get to decide in fine detail to which kind of audience you want to fine tune your ad. It reveals to you what the service you use knows about you.

Using tools that reveal what kind of trackers there are, ad blockers such as Ad Blocker, ![Privacy Badger](https://www.eff.org/privacybadger), or Disconnect, reveal to you what kind of information is interesting to advertisers as well as people trying to improve their services.

These services usually allow you to control the amount of information they collect about you. However, these control panels might be difficult to use. In 2018, Google was caught of still tracking users’ location, even though the user stated that they did not want to be tracked. 

Your online shadow is stored in cookies. Cookies are bits of information stored in your computer and they are not only bad. Have you ever been curious why Facebook started showing you ads of an item you just purchased? The answer is that the online store stored a cookie of your shopping cart into you browser, and Facebook read that cookie and is now showing you the ad. However, the cookie was quite handy tool for you while you were shopping, since it was able to remember you shopping cart while you went to take you dog out, while you looked for reviews and while you accidentally closed your browser - your shopping cart probably stayed intact and you didn’t need to refill it. 

Modern browsers allow tools to control your cookies - block them by default (be aware of lost features), deny automatically third-party cookies, and automated deleting of cookies when you quit your browser.
