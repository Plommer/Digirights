# Restrict annoying activities that are based on your data

You have now read through all the possibilities that the new digital rights allow you. If you still are not sure, here’s one more practical thing. 

How is your email inbox? Did you again receive an email you do not have the foggiest idea why you are receiving it? Especially after GDPR took force on 25th of May in 2018, the consent of the customer has become crucial in receiving marketing of any sort. Data protection authorities (DPA’s) in EU countries, are able to fine companies who send marketing emails or make marketing calls without the consent of the user. 

The Data Protection Officer in UK, the ICO, fined a company with £100 000 fine for making nuisance calls. The company, called AMS Marketing Ltd, had purchased a large list of personal data, and made over 75 000 calls to people. The calls were disturbing, and with the help of over 100 reports, ICO was able to investigate and fine the company.

If you did not consent for it, you should not receive it.

And if you still do, you are able to report your concerns to authorities. Find your local data protection officer via ![this list](http://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/article29/item-detail.cfm?item_id=612080)

Apart from your ability to report, your right to erasure should help in cleaning your inbox or incoming calls. This right is also called “the right to be forgotten”. If a company sends you marketing you wish not to receive, sending a request for the erasure of your data should do the trick, especially if your data is unlawfully used. There is no specific format for the request, but making it in written form is recommended. 

The best way to avoid unwanted marketing of all sort, is to always check the privacy notice and opt-out of marketing.
