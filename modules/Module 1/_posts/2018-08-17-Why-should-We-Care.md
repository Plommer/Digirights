# Module 1: Why Should We Citizens Care About Our Digital Rights?

### Learning outcomes of the module

The goal of this module is not that much to provide information about our digital rights but rather explore the opportunities of why they might be relevant to our lives even though we might not yet understand them or be able to see their future implications.  

## The EU has done a vast job in giving you now have more control on you online life. Know what you can do!

You might be thinking whatâ€™s with all this hassle with digital rights and be slightly annoyed by the way their current implementation bothers you but asking for your consent on web pages to use you data. The thing to understand is that there is a whole lot more to the picture than meets the eye at first.

Europe does not own any native large native digital consumer ecosystems, meaning the Apples, the Facebooks, the Amazons, the Microsoft or the Googles, most of our data has been subject to the legislation of whatever country these organizations chose to use as their legal base. Even though customer satisfaction is one of their goals, there come times when there are trade-offs between business and consumer concerns.

To foster the creation of a digital and data ecosystem for Europeans that is fair and demands that a certain level consumer rights respected, the General Data Protection Regulation came into being as the result of years of effort from the member countries. 

During their EU presidency in 2017, Estonia took the angle of highlighting the opportunities for building a digital Europe where the free movement of data should be the determined as the fifth freedom of the EU.  

Even though those privacy notices we see on most of the web pages we use might seem like a drag, we must remember that they are relatively new and, in time, we will being to see more mature and standardized ways of making consumers and citizens aware of how their data is used.

We have made the Digirights.info MOOC to help you understand these rights and empower you to exercise them.
