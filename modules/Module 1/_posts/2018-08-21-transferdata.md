# Understand where the data you created is transferred both legally and if it is hacked

Data is not useful when it is kept in one place, hence moving it around is required. The new rights allow you to know how your data is moved and object the moving your data. 

While giving your information to a service, try to seek for a privacy notice. There you should find answers to the questions why your data is collected, and how it will be used. Regarding transferring the data, you might be the most interested to know if the data is given to third parties, apart from the service (first party), and yourself (second party), who these third parties are, and why the data is transferred to them. Also, if the data is moved to overseas, it should read in there to which country and for what purposes the data is transferred.

The new rights also obligates companies and organisations to inform authorities, the local information commissioner and their customers about data breaches. Data breach happens, when the personal data of a company is accessed by wrong people, or if the company itself misuses the personal data they have.
