## Who is this for? 

Digital Citizen Rights can be complicated but we're working on putting their essentials in a language anyone can understand.  

You don't have to be a lawyer to take to course but come as yourself, an average citizen interested in having more control over your online life.

This course is for you if you're thinking about questions such as: 

- How can I stop irrelevant telemarketing? 
- Why and how do companies use my Loyalty Card data?
- How can I find information on how organizations use my data?  
- What benefits could I receive if I was able to receive my data?
- What would a society look like where I would be able to transfer My Data as needed? 

## When can I join in?

The first opportunities for taking the course will be in October 2018. 

Kurssin voi käydä myös suomeksi [digioikeudet.info](http://digioikeudet.info) -sivustolla lokakuussa 2018.
